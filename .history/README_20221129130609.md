## Features

- my own take on the layout ans styling
- can sign in with email
- can create an account
- once signed in, can post or "scroll" through other people's posts
- posts can now be images as well as plain text (inspiration from twitter)
[ please note: when you have created a post, you cannot edit it, you may delete it if you are unhappy but you cant edit it. (main reason...i dont understand why you would want to edit a post constantly. This forces you to think about what you will post.)]
- "image posts" look different than "text posts"
- can delete account
- when you delete your account, all your posts will also be deleted
- can edit account
- when you edit your account, your posts will automatically update to also show your new account details (like the profile pic or username)
- can delete your own posts
- after 1 hour you will automatically be logged out and will be required to sign in if you wish to use the app further
- can like a post
